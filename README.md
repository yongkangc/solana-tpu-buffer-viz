## üìò Understanding TPU Priority Fees

### How TPU Priority Queue Works

The Transaction Processing Unit (TPU) in Solana processes transactions through several key stages:

#### 1. Initial Processing

- **QUIC Streaming**: Transactions arrive via QUIC streams with stake-based rate limiting
- **Signature Verification**: Deduplication and filtering of invalid signatures
- **Banking Stage**: Determines whether to forward, hold, or process transactions

#### 2. Priority and Processing

- **Base Fee**: Standard fee for network resource usage
- **Priority Fee**: Additional fee for prioritization
- **Stake-Based Access**: Higher staked clients get more concurrent streams and bandwidth
- **Rate Limiting**: PPS (Packets Per Second) limits based on stake weight

#### 3. Queue Management

```
Priority = Base Fee + Priority Fee + (Compute Units √ó Current Market Rate)
```

The TPU manages transactions through:

- Stake-weighted admission control
- Dynamic load shedding for network stability
- Automatic backpressure during congestion

#### 4. TPU Buffer States

| Buffer State | Utilization | Fee Behavior                 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Low Load     | 0-50%       | Minimal priority fees needed |
| Medium Load  | 51-75%      | Moderate fee competition     |
| High Load    | 76-90%      | Aggressive fee competition   |
| Congested    | 91-100%     | Maximum fee competition      |

#### 5. Transaction Lifecycle

1. Transaction arrives at TPU
2. Priority score calculated
3. Inserted into priority queue
4. Reordering based on new arrivals
5. Processing based on final priority
