## 📘 Understanding TPU Priority Fees

### How TPU Priority Queue Works

The Transaction Processing Unit (TPU) in Solana implements a sophisticated priority queue system that determines transaction processing order based on several factors:

#### 1. Priority Fee Structure

- **Base Fee**: Every transaction includes a base fee (currently 5000 lamports)
- **Priority Fee**: Additional fee paid to increase transaction priority
- **Compute Units**: Resource usage cost for transaction execution

#### 2. Queue Mechanics

```
Priority Score = Base Fee + Priority Fee + (Compute Units × Current Market Rate)
```

The TPU buffer organizes transactions in a max-heap structure where:

- Higher priority fees get processed first
- Transactions with equal fees follow FIFO ordering
- Dynamic reordering occurs as new transactions arrive

#### 3. Market Dynamics

- **Supply & Demand**: Priority fees adjust based on buffer utilization
- **Network Load**: Higher network congestion → Higher required priority fees
- **Time Sensitivity**: Users compete for quick execution through fees

Example Priority Calculation:

```rust
transaction_priority = base_fee + priority_fee + (compute_units × market_rate)
// e.g., 5000 + 10000 + (200000 × 0.000001) = 15200 lamports
```

#### 4. TPU Buffer States

| Buffer State | Utilization | Fee Behavior                 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Low Load     | 0-50%       | Minimal priority fees needed |
| Medium Load  | 51-75%      | Moderate fee competition     |
| High Load    | 76-90%      | Aggressive fee competition   |
| Congested    | 91-100%     | Maximum fee competition      |

#### 5. Transaction Lifecycle

1. Transaction arrives at TPU
2. Priority score calculated
3. Inserted into priority queue
4. Reordering based on new arrivals
5. Processing based on final priority
